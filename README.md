# Advent-of-Code-2025
As with 2019 and 2020, I'm throwing together the shoddiest JavaScript implementations to each day's puzzle as fast as I can and logging them here for posterity because why not. This year it's only 12 days which means I'm more interested in doing the puzzles!  Previous years I always go home around Christmastime and miss the last 4-5 days...

OC do not steal :)
